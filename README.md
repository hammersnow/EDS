# EDS
EDS Control 
EDS/Eko/EDSCS I created a graphical interface program called EDSCS. This program shows the current operating status and error codes of mv3d-eds devices and also sends a warning beep signal. We can reset the computer services running on Mv3d devices by selecting the computer we want and resetting the services with a single click.
At the same time, we can call existing programs that I have previously created from here with a key shortcut.
This program runs in the background using the bash scripts I created in the Eko file and transfers the data and logs obtained from these scripts to the graphical interface program.
